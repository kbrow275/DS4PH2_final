**Project Description:**

We decided to explore the prediction of future Olympic medal outcomes. Initially, we planned to use only historical Olympic results as predictors. However, we later incorporated broader country-level information—such as population, GDP, and GDP per capita—based on the rationale that these factors might influence a country's likelihood of winning medals. 

Our final Streamlit app includes three interactive tabs:

1. Country-based Predictions: This tab allows users to input a country and receive predictions for the number of individual, doubles, and team medals expected at the next Summer and Winter Olympic Games, respectively.

2. Podium Predictor: In this tab, users can input a discipline and event name to view the predicted podium (top three countries) for the next games.

3. Historic Medal Explorer: This interactive bar plot visualizes the most recent Olympic results. After a country is selected, the chart displays the total medals won, with breakdowns by discipline shown through interactive bars.
